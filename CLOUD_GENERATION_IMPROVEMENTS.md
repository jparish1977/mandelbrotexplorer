# Cloud Generation UI Improvements

## Problem
The cloud generation process was blocking the UI thread, making the application unresponsive during generation. This was caused by the `generateMandelbrotCloudParticles()` function processing all pixels synchronously in nested loops.

## Solution
The cloud generation has been converted to an asynchronous process that:

1. **Breaks computation into batches**: Instead of processing all pixels at once, the work is divided into small batches (100 points per batch)
2. **Uses setTimeout for async processing**: Each batch is processed with `setTimeout(processBatch, 0)` to allow the UI to remain responsive
3. **Shows progress indicator**: A modal progress dialog displays:
   - Percentage completion
   - Visual progress bar
   - Cancel button to abort generation
4. **Handles cancellation**: Users can cancel generation at any time
5. **Maintains all existing functionality**: All filters, dual Z, particle systems, etc. work exactly as before

## Technical Changes

### Modified Functions:
- `generateMandelbrotCloudParticles()`: Now processes in async batches
- `applyMandelbrotCloudPalette()`: Also made async to prevent blocking
- `drawMandelbrotCloud()`: Updated to handle async completion

### Key Features:
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time percentage and visual progress
- **Cancellation support**: Users can cancel generation
- **Non-blocking UI**: Application remains responsive during generation
- **Batch processing**: Configurable batch size (currently 50 points)
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of cancelled operations
- **Identical output**: Maintains exact same processing order as original code

## Benefits
- ✅ UI remains responsive during cloud generation
- ✅ Users can see progress and cancel if needed
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better user experience for long-running generations
- ✅ Maintains all existing filters and features

## Usage
The changes are transparent to users. Simply click "Generate Cloud" as before, and you'll see:
1. A progress dialog appears
2. Progress bar shows completion percentage
3. UI remains responsive (can still interact with other controls)
4. Option to cancel generation
5. Automatic completion when done

## Configuration
The batch size can be adjusted by changing the `BATCH_SIZE` constant in `generateMandelbrotCloudParticles()`:
- Smaller batches = more responsive UI but slower overall
- Larger batches = faster overall but less responsive UI
- Current setting: 50 points per batch (good balance)

## Technical Implementation
The solution pre-computes all points to process in a flat array, maintaining the exact same processing order as the original nested loops. This ensures identical output while enabling asynchronous batch processing.
